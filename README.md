# rosecurves
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_%28mathematics%29#Programming - A rose curve is created in a system of polar coordinates, but the equation can be modified to be used with cartesian coordinates. I used the equations as written in the programming section of the Rhodonea curve wikipedia article (linked above). The k value in the equations is what forms the shape of the rose. It is found by dividing two random whole numbers, from 1-9, or by randomly generating a value between 0 and 1. Irrational values for k create unclosed curves with infinite length; rational values create closed curves.
